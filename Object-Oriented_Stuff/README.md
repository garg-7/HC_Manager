## Here lies the OODesign stuff

In this folder you'll find the CRC cards, the activity diagram, the class diagram and the use-case diagram. All of their `.png` and `.mdj` files.
  
Some of the images are huge and the snips are a little blurry, so to get a clearer view you could open the `.mdj` files using [StarUML](https://staruml.io).


Continuing down the Object-Oriented road, here are some details of the project -

#### Actors
* **Patients** (including students, staff & faculty)
* **Doctor's Office** at the health center (including reception staff & doctors)
* **Pharmacy** at the health center
* **Faculty Members** (separate to provide some privileges and to make enquiries regarding students)
* **Office of Academics** (manages record of medical leaves and facilitates student ID verification)
* **Office of Accounts** (recording medical expenses incurred against the amount each student is insured for)

#### Workflow
We could go on and on about how every user interacts with the system as they log in but that would be tedious and most people tend to skip that, so instead, just take a look at [`activity_diagram.png`](activity_diagram.png) (or [`activity_diagram.mdj`](activity_diagram.mdj)), to get an idea of how everything is related and works together.
