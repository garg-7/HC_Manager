# Health Center Management System

This is a management system for the health center at IIT-Jodhpur. It was developed as a course project for CS212: Object Oriented Analysis & Design by [Devin](https://github.com/garg-7/), [Kartik](https://github.com/vyaskartik20) & [Mahendra](https://github.com/mahendra2890).
  
The aim of this project was to help develop an understanding (via an exemplar implementation) of object-oriented design of systems.
  
## Object-Oriented Design
Owing to the object-oriented design, first the actors of this system were recognized along with their interactions with the system. This was consolidated in the form of the following:
* [Class Responsibility & Collaboration a.k.a. CRC cards](Object-Oriented_Stuff/)
* [Use-Case diagram](Object-Oriented_Stuff/)
* [Class diagram](Object-Oriented_Stuff/)
* [Activity diagram](Object-Oriented_Stuff/)
  
Note: the above visualisations have been created with the help of a great modeling tool [StarUML](https://staruml.io/).

## Requirements
The project is built using vanilla C++. No external dependencies. You could simply run the executable according to your platform.
  
### Windows
You people can run the `hc_win.exe` file.
  
### Ubuntu
(Since it has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.4, being completely conservative we've mentioned Ubuntu as the title here but there is no reason you couldn't run this on any Linux distro).
  
You can run the following on terminal.
```bash
bash hc_lin.out
```
